# Airbnb
In this project, I aim to understand Airbnb rental landscape in Seattle City through exploratory analysis on the Airbnb dataset. Through static visualizations, I try to answer the below questions:
* How do prices of listings vary by location/neighbourhood?
* How do the ratings vary by location/neighbourhood?
* What are the different types of properties in Seattle?
* How is the popularity for Airbnb in Seattle? 
* How does the demand for Airbnb rentals fluctuate across the year?
* Is there a correlation between demand and prices of the rentals? [Not sufficient data to answer it but tried]
* What is the occupancy rate for next year?
* Is it expensive to travel on weekends?
* What is the opinion of the guests about Seattle Airbnbs?
* What makes a host a Super host?
